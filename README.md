In this project, I aim to predict the demand for different items and quantify the expected sales volume based on the season. The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as age, gender, location, subscription status, and more, which will be used to train a machine learning model. 

The objective is to provide valuable insights to retail businesses, allowing them to optimize inventory levels, manage supply chains efficiently, and enhance overall operational performance. Key stakeholders in this project include retail managers, inventory planners, and marketing teams.

By training models on this dataset, the algorithm can learn patterns and correlations between various features and the sales performance of items during different seasons. The project's outcome is a valuable tool for retail businesses seeking to stay competitive in a dynamic market.
